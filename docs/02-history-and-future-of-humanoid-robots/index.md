## Introduction

Humanoid robots, designed to resemble and mimic human form and behavior, represent one of the most ambitious areas of robotics research. The pursuit of creating human-like machines has captivated inventors, researchers, and the public for centuries, evolving from simple mechanical automata to sophisticated AI-powered systems capable of complex interactions.

The development of humanoid robots has been driven by multiple motivations, including scientific curiosity about human intelligence, practical applications in human environments, and the desire to create companions or assistants that can interact naturally with humans.

## Historical Development

### Early Automata (18th-19th Century)

The concept of humanoid machines dates back centuries. Early examples include:
- The Mechanical Turk (1770) - a chess-playing automaton
- Jaquet-Droz's writing automata (1768-1774) - dolls that could write, draw, and play music
- These early machines, while not truly autonomous, demonstrated the human fascination with creating lifelike artificial beings

### Early 20th Century Foundations

The 20th century saw the development of more sophisticated mechanical systems:
- Westinghouse's Elektro (1939) - a robot that could walk, talk, and smoke cigarettes
- These early attempts laid groundwork for more complex control systems

### Modern Era Beginnings (1970s-1990s)

The modern era of humanoid robotics began with:
- WABOT-1 (1972) at Waseda University - the first full-scale anthropomorphic robot
